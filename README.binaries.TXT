I have included two binaries in this package, one for Linux (ELF), and 
one for SunOS 5.5.

You can use these if you don't feel like (or can't) compile your own.

The Linux binary was compiled with -O2 and no other special switches, on 
my Linux 2.0.27 386.  It should work on pretty much any Linux box.

The SunOS binary was compiled on my ISP's machine, which I luckily have a 
shell account on.  I don't know much about SunOS, so it might or might 
not work for you.  

If all else fails, the binaries don't work, make dyn won't compile, hack 
the source code youself or drop me a line
